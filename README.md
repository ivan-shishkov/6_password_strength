# Password Strength Calculator

This script allows to calculate a password strength with a score from 1 (very poor password) to 10 (very strong password).

# Quickstart

For script launch need to install Python 3.5 and then install all dependencies:

```

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Example of script launch on Linux (for security reasons, the password entered by the user is not displayed):

```

$ python3 password_strength.py
Enter a password for analysis:
------------------------------------
Score of password strength:  9 of 10
------------------------------------

```
